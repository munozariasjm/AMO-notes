    "\n",
    "## 5.1 Spontaneous Force\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Definition**: Force exerted on atoms by the momentum transfer of photons, typically involving absorption and spontaneous emission.\n",
    "- **Key Formula**:\n",
    "  - Recoil momentum: $ \\Delta p = -\\hbar k $\n",
    "  - Spontaneous force: $ F = \\frac{\\hbar k \\Gamma_{sc}}{1 + s_0 + \\left(\\frac{2\\delta}{\\Gamma}\\right)^2} $ \n",
    "\n",
    "## 5.2 Laser Cooling: Optical Molasses\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Concept**: Optical molasses use two counter-propagating lasers to create a viscous damping force that cools atoms.\n",
    "- **Key Formulas**:\n",
    "  - Force from one direction: $ F_+ = \\frac{\\hbar k s_0 \\Gamma / 2}{1 + s_0 + \\left[2(\\delta - kv)/\\Gamma\\right]^2} $\n",
    "  - Total force: $ F = F_+ + F_- $\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5.3 The Magneto-Optical Trap (MOT)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Concept**: Combines optical molasses with magnetic fields to trap and cool atoms.\n",
    "- **Key Formula**:\n",
    "  - MOT force: $ F_{\\pm} = \\pm \\frac{\\hbar k \\Gamma s_0}{1 + s_0 + \\left(2 \\delta_{\\pm} / \\Gamma \\right)^2} $ \n",
    "\n",
    "## 5.4 Photon Cycling\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Concept**: Repeated scattering of photons on atoms, critical in laser cooling for maintaining the cycle of absorption and emission.\n",
    "- **Example**: Using additional \"repump\" lasers to return atoms to the cycling transition.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5.5 Dipole Force\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Concept**: Non-scattering force arising from the interaction of an induced dipole with an electromagnetic field gradient.\n",
    "- **Key Formulas**:\n",
    "  - Dipole force: $ F = -\\nabla U = -\\nabla \\left(\\frac{d^2 I}{2 c \\epsilon_0 \\hbar \\delta}\\right) $ \n",
    "  - Energy shifts due to dipole trap: $ U = \\pm \\frac{I d^2}{2 c \\epsilon_0 \\hbar \\delta} $ \n",
    "\n",
    "## 5.6 Light Shifts\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Concept**: Changes in energy levels of atoms due to interaction with light, affecting resonance frequencies.\n",
    "- **Key Formula**:\n",
    "  - Light shift: $ \\delta_{LS} = \\frac{2U}{\\hbar} $ \n",
    "\n",
    "## 5.7 Stimulated Forces\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Concept**: Forces based on stimulated emissions, which differ from spontaneous force due to their coherent nature.\n",
    "- **Application**: Used to precisely control atomic motion without spontaneous emission losses.\n",
